		<u><h3>My Scratch Projects</h3></u>
		<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/119031117/#editor"><img src="images/My Website Scratch.PNG" height="250"></a><br>
		<p>This is my 1.1.3 Scratch Project. We made a head
		fly across the screen when the spacebar is pressed. Click the pic to check it out!</p>
		<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/120277288/#editor"><img src="images/A Knight's Tale.PNG" height="250"></a><br>
		<p> This is a scratch project that I did with my partner Janson Law where we took the images of knights from medieval warfare. We clashed this with music from the critically aclaimed show "Game of Thrones" on HBO.
		<a href="https://repl.it/DcqG/9"><img src="images/Capture.PNG" height="150"></a><br>
		<p>This is my 1.3.3b Scratch Project. My partner Peter Zheng, and I, took what we learned from our instant challenge last week and applied it to our ripl.it project.
		<a href="https://repl.it/Dw3K/36"><img src"images/treasurehunt.PNG" height="150"></a><br>
		<p>This is my Python app project that I completed with my partner William Ngyuen. We came up with the idea to do it as a tresure hunt where the user has to complete the aspects of it in order to get to the treasure at the end.</p>
